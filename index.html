			<h1 class="mt-5">Social Media, Big Data and Information Systems in Health OR64 Conference Stream Call for Abstracts (CfA)</h1>
			<p  class="lead">In line with the “OR for a Better World Together” conference theme this year, this stream is dedicated to how digital platforms and social media (in its broadest sense) can support a better and more sustainable world recovering from COVID-19 and beyond. The stream welcomes presentations on health and wellbeing focused applications, and health information systems, with a particular focus on approaches leveraging novel unstructured big data, such as social media content and behaviours, and related AI/ML and analytics. We welcome interdisciplinary research, as well as research that considers ethical and algorithmic bias related concerns in particular.</p>
			<p>Every government, every hospital, every clinic and every person (in other words each and every one of us) will encounter new technologies and innovations in healthcare with all of their potentials and problems. This stream includes talks addressing a variety of approaches and issues, and will be of interest to academics across the field, as well as practitioners in public and private sectors alike.</p>
